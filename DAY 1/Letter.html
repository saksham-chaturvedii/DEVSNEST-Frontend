          <br><br>Dear Jason,
          <p>
            I’m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective August 14, 2020. <br><br>

            I’ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September. I’m tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition. <br><br>
            
            I’ve truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It’s rare to find a customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, as well as such a positive, inspiring team of people to grow and learn with. <br><br>
            
            I’m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your support has meant so much to me. <br><br>
            
            Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.
        </p>
        Thanks and best wishes,<br>
        Nicole Thomas
